<!-- Git status check
     git status
// Files in your Git repository folder can be in one of 2 states: 
   1. Tracked : files that git knows about and are added to the repository 
   2. Untracked : files that are in your working directory , but not added to teh repositry 

   When you first add files to an empty repository , they are all untracked. To get Git to track them, you need to stage them, or add them  to staging environment. -->
